This document is a business plan for creating an "Omniwallet for-profit company".
This implementaion is under consideration, but hasn't been endorsed by the Mastercoin Foundation board.

Feedback is welcome. 

FYI, the Omniwallet.co initiative is [recruiting a CEO](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ko016DY-fK-_FvvE86IVYwuSPUUUOZtHxInH1i9LGqo/viewform).
    
# Core Mission Statement

AKA 20 second pitch to Mastercoiners

[Omniwallet](https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/omniwallet) is the best, free, open source, secure, multi-currency wallet there is in the market. It can maintian the widely endorsed values of transparency, opensource and distributedness and still be a profit seeking initiative. All major digital currencies can easily be incorporated by offering a forkable module new currency issuers can modify and integrate.

# Two minute pitch

The Omniwallet project was started by the Mastercoin Foundation as a secure, open source, multi-currency wallet. It is perhaps the only web wallet that supports multiple digital currencies other than [Counterwallet](https://counterwallet.co/).

Omniwallet is getting better and better every day. With hundreds of crowdsales that will be selling "access to service tokens" issued on Master Protocol in the next six months, we predict that the traction to omniwallet.org will increase immensely. We would like to make sure that the Omniwallet project has everything it needs in order to support the token issuers and crowdsale participants in the best possible way.

Omniwallet can easily expand to be a wallet for all currencies based on the Master Protocol but ALSO a home to all alt-currencies, including such currencies as Counterparty, XRP, Colored Coins, Ethers, Litecoins, Peercoins, Dogecoins...

Currently, each of the currencies available in the market have their own wallets and users lack a "single wallet to rule them all". This is a real pain point for the all the market participants, and expected to grow with the viral adoption that [Appcoins](https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/TheValueofAppCoins) are demonstrating.

The original vision behind Omniwallet is to be the "wallet for all". It was conceived to be completely open where if members of the community identified a currency not supported, a pull request would be the easy-fix. If there was a delay or denial on the pull request (e.g. currency suggested has too small a market cap), then anyone would be free to fork the wallet and host their own version.

Here is a proposol to give autonomy to Omniwallet, have it be an independent initiative for it to truly do "what's best for Omniwallet".

# Company Structure and Legal Aspects

See [The Definitive Guide to Crowdsales Legality](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MawzhmDfKGCPnXva_C3QcK7KA0llxmrnEBE4ZTtlesU/edit#)

A company should be formed in some crypto-friendly regulatory regime (Isle of Man?). The company will pass these board resolutions:

1. Create a coin dubbed OmniCoin.
2. Promise to always give some percent (100%?) of all dividends to holders of this coin. This promise can be anchored by the controlling structure of the company in an immutable way.
3. Allocate a percentage of OmniCoins for an employee retention plan. People working on Omniwallet will receive OmniCoins per a predefined vesting and cliff structure.

The company will then distribute some percentage of all outstanding OmniCoins to all holders of MSC, thus compensating MSC holders for backing the Mastercoin Foundation and supporting the development of Omniwallet thus far. Then, the company can sell OmniCoins and raise money to fund future development.

# Quotes

1. *Yoni Assia, eToro* - "AWESOME IDEA! I indeed think this would be great both for colored coins and for mastercoin, and could become an industry leader in multi asset wallets."
2. *Jeremy Kandah, DApps Fund* - "In the future, there will be an abundant amount of block chain property (currencies, equities, tokens, etc.).  Creating the best place to use that property is a game changer."
3. *David Johnston, DAps Fund* - "Omni Wallet gaining a dedicated team to build out its functions is an awesome sign of it maturing as a platform for all kinds of crypto currencies to build on top of it."

# Team

Mastercoin Foundation RBBs who work primarily on Omniwallet should probably migrate (full-time or part-time) to be formally employed by the company, using the funds raised by selling Omniwallet.

# Monetization Model

1. Promotion of crowdsales via a dedicated directory/vetted partner program 
2. Charging for API calls
3. Charging for premium features e.g issuing coins
  1. The Master Protocol itself will not charge for issuing coins. However the Omniwallet platform can charge for an easy wrapper on that. The wrapper is and can remain open source.
  2. The fee can be taken as a percentage of coins issued, and liquidated to MSC/BTC/USD as needed.
  3. The exact fee structure and schedule is TBD.
4. Rev-shares with affiliates such as CoinPowers, Swarm and CODA.
5. TBD... - If we believe we can get a million users, monetization will follow naturally. We don’t have to have all the answers now.

# Crowdsale Model

TBD - link to David Johnston’s white paper on setting crowdsale properties.

1. X% goes for existing MSC holders, Y% to new investors, Z% as a Dev Pool with a pre-defined vesting/cliff schedule.
2. Need to decide on the exact crowdsale model (distribution of the Y%). A public sale for 1 month with some cap C?
3. Should the company give ALL of its revenue to holders of OmniCoins? Or should it keep some revenue for itself? Is the company just a ‘holder’ but has no value, with all the value residing on coins?
4. Does the company need a buyback model - the ability to buy the coins at a certain (high) value, in case e.g. the company is sold off to Blockchain.info in some future, and Blockchain.info do not want to use the OmniCoins model?

# FAQ

## What are the benefits of branching Omniwallet off, rather than continuing as a unit of the Mastercoin Foundation?

1. Correctly incentivizes Omniwallet developers to do "whatever is best for Omni", regardless of the benefit of Mastercoin. E.g. if an opportunity arises to integrate other Appcoin protocols or alt-chains into Omni, the Omni developers should only do whatever is best for Omniwallet. We don’t want a conflict of interests here affecting their decisions.
2. Keeps the incentive of the MSC holders. Since OmniCoins are automatically awarded to each holder of MSC in proportion to their MSC holdings, if the company is wildly successful, holders of MSC share in that revenue stream.
3. Attracts additional capital - new investment money will pour in to buy OmniCoins by people who believe in its monetization model.
4. Significantly lowers the capital expense of the Mastercoin Foundation, and thus increases its runway. The Foundation can still compensate Omni developers as needed, but will focus its compensation on contributions to the core protocol, leaving the bulk of the compensation to be derived from the company’s revenue stream.

## What are the risks and unintended consequences of branching Omniwallet off?

TBD - https://github.com/Omniwallet/docs/issues/6

## What is the need for a separate OmniCoin? Why not just tie the company to Mastercoin?

1. As stated above, this ensures a correct incentivisation of Omni developers and investors that is separate from the incentivization of MSC holders. By allowing the value of OmniwalletCoins and Mastercoins to diverge, people who invest time/attention/resources in one project aren’t directly affected by the other. This is an important tool for the market to correctly funnel resources to the specific Omniwallet project.
2. This is a means for an additional funding round. Issuing OmniwalletCoins will attract further capital that is interested in the concept of a multi-currency wallet but not in Mastercoin, and will be used to fund development.
3. Developers and other team members moving (fully or partly) from the Mastercoin Foundation to Omniwallet.co will help reduce the burn rate of the Foundation and let it concentrate on its core mission - building the Master Protocol, and its refernce implementation [Master Core](https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/mastercore).

## Does this mean the roadmap for Omniwallet is changing? 

The Omniwallet team will have complete autonomy to decide on its focus, priorities and roadmap. We do not propose we change anything in the current short-term roadmap. A lot of Omniwallet stakeholders are Mastercoin stakeholders, and we certainly do not want to do ANYTHING that can interfere with that.

We do not believe that the team should focus on monetization right now, but rather on product and growth. Monetization will come later.
